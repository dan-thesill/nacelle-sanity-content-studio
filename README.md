## Nacelle Base Schema

By cloning this Content Studio Starter we've already got all of the schemas needed to setup content on your Nacelle build.

### Local development

1. **Install the Sanity CLI globally with `npm install -g @sanity/cli`**

2. **Initialize project by running `sanity init` in the root folder.**
    - This will log you in to Sanity, create a project, set up a dataset, and generate the files needed to run the editing environment locally.
    
3. **Install dependencies with `npm install` in the root folder.**

4. **Start the development server by running `sanity start` or `npm run start` in root folder**
